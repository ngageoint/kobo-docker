# Temporary setup procedure:
1. [Install Docker Compose on 64-bit Linux](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). OS X and Windows power users can try [the new Docker beta for those platforms](https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/docker-for-mac-windows-beta/).
2. Determine whether you want to create an HTTP-only **local** instance of KoBo Toolbox, or a HTTPS publicly-accessible **server** instance. Local instances will use [`docker-compose.local.yml`](./docker-compose.local.yml) and [`envfile.local.txt`](./envfile.local.txt), whereas server instances will use [`docker-compose.server.yml`](./docker-compose.server.yml) and [`envfile.server.txt`](./envfile.server.txt) instead.  
**Note:** For server instances, you are expected to have a valid SSL certificate for your domain (see below) and some basic knowledge of server administration and the use of SSL.
3. Based on your desired instance type, create a symlink named `docker-compose.yml` to either [`docker-compose.local.yml`](./docker-compose.local.yml) or [`docker-compose.server.yml`](./docker-compose.server.yml) (e.g. `ln -s docker-compose.local.yml docker-compose.yml`). Alternatively, you can skip this step and explicitly prefix all Docker Compose commands like `docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml`.
4. Pull the latest images from Docker Hub: `docker-compose pull`. **Note:** Be careful when pulling updated images to delete the old using `docker rmi` so your drive doesn't fill up.
5. Build any images you've chosen to manually override: `docker-compose build`.
6. Edit the appropriate environment file for your instance type, [`envfile.local.txt`](./envfile.local.txt) or [`envfile.server.txt`](./envfile.server.txt), filling in **all** mandatory variables, and optional variables as needed.
7. **Server-only steps:**
  1. Make a `secrets` directory in the project root and copy the SSL certificate and key files to `secrets/ssl.crt` and `secrets/ssl.key` respectively. **The certificate and key are expected to use exactly these filenames and must comprise either a wildcard or SAN certificate+key pair which are valid for the domain and subdomains specified in [`envfile.server.txt`](./envfile.server.txt).**
  2. If testing on a server that is not publicly accessible at the subdomains you've specified in [`envfile.server.txt`](./envfile.server.txt), put an entry in your host machine's `/etc/hosts` file for each of the three subdomains you entered to reroute such requests to your machine's address (e.g. `192.168.1.1 kf-local.kobotoolbox.org`). Also, uncomment and configure the `extra_hosts` directives in [`docker-compose.server.yml`](./docker-compose.server.yml).
8. Optionally stop and clear previously built `kobo-docker` containers: `docker-compose stop; docker-compose rm`.
9. Optionally clear persisted files (e.g. the Postgres database) from previous runs, **taking care that you are in the `kobo-docker` directory**: `sudo rm -rf .vols/ log/`.
10. Start the server: `docker-compose up -d` (or without the `-d` option to run in the foreground).
11. Container output can be viewed with `docker-compose logs`. For an individual container, logs can be viewed by using the container name from your `docker-compose.yml` with e.g. `docker-compose logs enketo_express`.

# TODO
* KoBoCAT login redirect (e.g https://kc-local.kobotoolbox.org -> https://kf-local.kobotoolbox.org/accounts/login/?next=/kobocat/ -> https://kf-local.kobotoolbox.org/kobocat/ -> `404`)
* Maps?
